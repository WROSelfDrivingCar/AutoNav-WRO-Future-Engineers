**Schemes**

This folder contains the circuit and wiring diagrams for our self-driving car developed for the WRO Future Engineers project. These schemes provide a clear visual representation of how the components are connected and powered.

**Contents:**

**Wiring Diagram:** Detailed schematic showing connections between components such as the Arduino Nano, Raspberry Pi, color sensor, motor driver (L293D), and motors.

**Power Distribution:** Diagram illustrating the power supply setup using LM2596 and 7805 voltage regulators.

**Sensor Integration:** Schematics for connecting the color sensor and camera to their respective controllers (Arduino and Raspberry Pi).
