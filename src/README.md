**Source Code (src)**

This folder contains the source code for our self-driving car project developed for the WRO Future Engineers challenge. The code is responsible for managing the vehicle's navigation, obstacle detection, and motor control.

**Contents:**

**Arduino Code:** Scripts for controlling the motors and reading data from the color sensors.
**Raspberry Pi Code:** Python scripts for obstacle detection using the webcam and controlling the communication between the Pi and Arduino.
**Motor Control:** Functions to move the vehicle forward, turn, and stop based on sensor inputs.
**Sensor Calibration:** Code for calibrating the color sensor to accurately detect different colors.
